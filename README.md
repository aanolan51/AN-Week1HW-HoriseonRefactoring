# AN-Week1HW-HoriseonRefactoring
Code Refactoring HW

# Description 
A website needed some additional work completed. This project scope involved cleaning up the style.css file, adding some additional features for accessibility to the HTML code, and ensuring all links and HTML code were working as intended. I learned how to consolidate repetitive code and troubleshoot link usage in an HTML document.

# Usage
The <img> tags have had additional features added. A title attribute and an alt attribute were added for accessbility. The title provides text when hovering over the image and the alt attribute provides a description of the picture if it doesn't load properly on the web page. These can be updated as needed to provide the appropriate descriptions.
